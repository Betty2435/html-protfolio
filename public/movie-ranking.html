<h2>My Top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Two Weeks Notice</h3>
<p>“Two Weeks Notice” is a romantic comedy and it stars Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant,when they meet for the first time, they don’t like each other. That circumstances bring them together. That they get along fine, but are sometimes scared by that and back off a little. That they are falling in love without knowing it. That just when they’re about to know it, circumstances force them apart. That they seem doomed to live separately, their love never realized. That circumstances bring them back together again. That they finally cave in and admit they’re in love. </p>
<h3>My Sailor My Love</h3>
<p>“My Sailor, My Love,” is a prickly tale of familial love gone sour and romantic love found almost too late. Although it attempts to tackle the heavy theme of generational trauma, it too often forgoes the more insightful aspects of its family drama in favor of an overly trite twilight romance. </p>
<h3>After The Bite</h3>
<p>“After the Bite”, it focuses on a tragedy in 2018, when a young man named Arthur Medici was attacked and killed by a shark off a beach in Wellfleet, Massachusetts. The attack wasn’t a fluke—great white sharks had been seen more often near the beaches in past years. But it inspired a wealth of various responses. Some people wanted to learn how to better live with them, like the scientists who tag sharks and can follow their movement. Others thought aabout where to place guilt: on bad infrastructure, on the ballooning seal population that mixes with human swimmers, and more. </p>
